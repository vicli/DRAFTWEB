I've finally been bitten by the twitter bug.
<br/><br/>
Yeah it took me a while. Like ~5 years. But now I <strong>get</strong> twitter, and I'm loving it. Heres a little explanation as to why it took me so long. 
<br/><br/>

<strong>Then and Now: </strong>
<br/><br/>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Then:  </strong>When I first learned of Twitter 5 years ago, I was a 15 yr. old kid with a pretty average life. I assumed (correctly) that no one was interested in my adolescent musings.  <strong>Now:</strong> I'm much more aware of my thoughts and opinions. And I'm brave (or stupid?) enough to broadcast them to the public world. </li>
	<li><strong>Then: </strong>Social media wasn't really a thing. Sharing involved pasting links through MSN or emails. Tweeting to my mind then was basically an invitation for creepy internet stalkers.  <strong>Now: </strong> What a long way we've come. It's crazy how much social media has infiltrated our lives, and how quick we are to adopt new technoogies and put information about ourselves out there.</li>
	<li><strong>Then: </strong>News came to me via Newsweek, Times and maybe a daily physical newspaper. Information was out there, but it took a little searching and a little work.  <strong>Now: </strong> We've pretty much grown into a world that <em>thrives</em> on having information, and lots of it. With the boom of all things digital, information and data are literally at our finger tips. Data is shared at an almost instant pace, and as a result, keeping up with all this information is pretty much impossible. Thankfully, twitter makes this a million times easier for me to manage, and I'm able to keep up with the news that I'm personally interested in. </li>
	<li><strong>Then: </strong> To put it bluntly - I gave zero shits about technology. I was a bookworm with the goal of becoming a neurosurgeon. <strong>Now: </strong> I've turned to CS, so if I don't use twitter I'll basically be shunned by the CS community. It's all about self preservation. </li>
