This will be my first (and hopefully successful) foray into blogging. I'd imagine this would encourage me to get off my ass and <span style ="color:#840000; text-weight: bold"> do </span> things, and also learn a little bit more about the computer science world that I've been wading in for the past two years.
<br/>

A obligatory about me:
I'm currently a student at MIT, class of 2015. I've struggled with what I've wanted to do, and unexpectedly settled on Computer Science despite never touching it before January 2012. I've learned <span style ="color:#840000; text-weight: bold"> tons </span> (even that's an understatement), and am still learning day by day. While I don't think I'll ever be a giant in the CS world, I hope to build a big enough block for me to stand on. 
<br/>

Cheers!
