I don’t look like a dancer.
<br/>
<br />
Graceless and stocky, I resemble an unfit rugby defender if anything (yes I used to play rugby). 
<br/>
<br />
I don’t particularly like performing. I shy away from situations where I’m in the spotlight. 
<br/>
<br />
I barely listen to hip hop, if at all. I don’t understand rap, and ‘all I want for my birthday is a big booty hoe’ just doesn’t cut it for me.
<br />
<br />
Yet somehow I’ve found myself <em>obsessed</em> with dance, as in, attend-6-classes-per-week obsessed. I binge watch dance videos (check out my current favorite sets from static noyze and academy of villians). I can identify dancers by name as well as the songs they’ve choreographed to. I run choreo in my head as I wait for my code to compile, and practice speed control as I wait for BART. 
<br />
<br />
Most people are surprised that MIT has a huge dance community.  I know I was. A school of engineers seem to (by stereotypical definition) lack the coordination and grace needed for dance. Yet somehow, MIT is central to the Boston dance community, a feeder into the many dance groups in the area. 
<br /><br />
The first time I ever danced was during MIT’s DanceTroupe (DT) auditions freshmen fall, where ~300 students attempt to get into the ~20 dances that were part of the semester DT dance show. The only reason why I was there was because 1) the president of DT then lived on my floor and basically forced me to go and 2) my friends decided to go. I had zero desire to be there, and only remained because I refused to bitch out. Plus it was college, so why not? 
<br />
<br />
The next 4 hours were an embarassing whirlwind of me trying to be graceful for the contemporary piece, and remembering the moves for the hiphop piece. Auditions were done in groups of 10, and I’m pretty sure I was ‘dancing’ half a beat off with an unattractive grimace on my face. Oh well.
<br />
<br />
Results came in the form of an email. Holy shit. I had gotten into 3 dances: the beginner hiphop collabo, an intermediate hiphop piece, and an intermediate contemporary piece. I was shocked, ecstatic and extremely nervous. What had I gotten myself into? 
<br />
<br />
I don’t remember much of the dances that first semester, except that it was challenging, novel, and extremely fun. I kept dancing because it was just a ‘thing’ that my group of friends did. But as the semesters went by, I realized I was dancing for a much more deeper reason. Yes it was fun and yes, I had many friends who did it. But I knew I was dancing for a greater benefit. 
<br />
<br />
I danced because I became comfortable with who I <strong>was</strong> when I performed the steps. Each piece required a mask, but it seemed like the masks, rather than being completely made up, were somehow projections of me. With each piece I performed, it was like a little bit of the ‘me’ that I had suppressed  came to surface. The more I danced, the more of me I felt. I was more aware of my movements, of my body and of my senses. It became more about the moment than about the past. I was more critical of how I did things, yet critical in an amicable sort of way that focused more on <em>how</em> I needed to change to accomplish something as opposed to <em>why</em> whatever I was doing was wrong. Oddly enough, I was dancing to become a better person, to become a better me. It wasn’t for the joy of performance, or for the entertainment of others. It was entirely selfish, a form of self-discovery and therapy that left me fuller on the inside and lighter on the outside.

Ever since that first audition, I’ve been dancing. I’m not very good. I’m not very graceful. I can’t remember fast moves, and the concept of swag evades me. But I still call myself a dancer. I love it, and hopefully one day, you will come to realize that you do too.
