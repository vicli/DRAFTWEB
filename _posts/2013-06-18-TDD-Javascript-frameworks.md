Apparently Test Driven Development (TDD) hasn't quite made it to 650 California Street, San Francisco.
<br />

Learning ALL of my coding skills at college as unexpectedly brought about a huge (and probably the only) benefit: I have stellar coding habits. Coding at MIT is a rigorous experience, and anything less than quality code will promptly and unmercifully be shat on. 
<br />
As a result, I follow pretty impeccable code practices. I write my tests BEFORE my code(this shocks even me), draft up design docs when needed, comment thoroughly and modularize when possible.
