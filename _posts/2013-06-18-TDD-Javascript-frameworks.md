Apparently Test Driven Development (TDD) hasn't quite made it to 650 California Street, San Francisco.
<br />

Learning ALL of my coding skills at college as unexpectedly brought about a huge (and probably the only) benefit: I have stellar coding habits. Coding at MIT is a rigorous experience, and anything less than quality code will promptly and unmercifully be shat on. 


As a result, I follow pretty impeccable code practices. I write my tests BEFORE my code(this shocks even me), draft up design docs when needed, comment thoroughly and modularize when possible.

Turns out this isn't how it works in the real world, especially in startups seeking to push out their product. Unfortunately, having a small team means tradeoffs, and on the start of my internship with AppDirect a week ago, there was no front end testing framework set up. 

While this was a little shocking considering how massive the code base was, it made sense in the bigger picture. AppDirect, which grew from 20 to a 100 in the recent <em>year</em> had no need for extensive front end testing. Everything worked, and because it was a company built by back-end engineers, everything was rendered in wicket. Testing impeded progress, testing was a time sink, and testing got in the way of pushing out the product. Time was everything, and in a time where Software as a Service as a market has just began to boom, they needed to edge their foot in quick.
