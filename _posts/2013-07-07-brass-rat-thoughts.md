San Francisco is wonderful. I've done more new things in the past month (has it really only been a month?!) than I have in the past semester at school. I've visited dozens of tech offices, met more people than I thought was possible, and tried new foods, new places and new beers. Each time I do something awesome AKA every single day, I nudge myself and think: is this what adult life is like?
<br /><br />
I'm 50% done with college. Two more years, and I'll be out of the revolving door and into the "real world". So far, my experiences with the real world has been amazing, eye opening, and maybe even life changing. I <em>love</em> adult life. I <em>love</em> working on a real product on a real team and doing real things. But despite all the ups that being an adult brings, I don't think I'll be ready for it two years down the road. I don't think I can quite leave the idea of college, of MIT, and all the people I've come to know and love so deeply. It's fucking scary.
<br /><br />
In two months, I'll be stepping onto Memorial Drive as a junior, shiny brass rat on my finger. Despite my repeated self-denial that <em>I am not growing up</em>, I know that my time at MIT is slowly but swiftly coming to an end. It feels like yesterday since I pulled up to 410 Memorial Drive, yesterday since I stayed up till 4am exploring BC with my very first MIT friends. Everytime I think about it, I get a little sentimental, a little sad, and little overwhelmed by all the feelings and things I want to say. 
<br /><br />
Things I've learned in my first two years at MIT:
<br />
<br />
<strong>1. Friendships are organic</strong><br /><br />
Perhaps the greatest change from freshmen to sophomore year was realizing that my friends grew differently. While freshmen year was a clusterfuck of GIRS and bonding sessions that resulted in a 'wolf-pack' mentality, sophomore year was more about figuring out what we wanted to do individually. My friends became busier, consumed by their majors, their activities, their priorities. I grew apart from some, became closer to others, and found myself doubting college friendships. It was a high school sort of mentality: why didn't we do X anymore? Did Y not treasure our friendship enough to spend more time with me? I had such a firm grasp on what our friendships should be that I forgot the most obvious thing about life: people grow. <br /><br />
It's okay that we grew apart. It's okay that we only talked once a week. I finally was able to understand that a change in the time spent did not equate to a change in the relationship. My friendships didn't dwindle; rather, they transformed, a reflection of both me and my friend's growth. And even when our priorities changed, they were all still there for me. Hugging me with joy, consoling me when I was stressed, listening to my complaints, and being there for me every step of the way. Without a doubt, it is <em>because of them</em> that I've managed to make it through MIT. I've become a happier, more self-assured person through them. and

<br />
<br />
<strong>2. It's okay to want to be alone</strong><br /><br />
For me, being in an awesome living group surrounded with a great group of friends was stressful. Stressful in the sense that I felt I was being either a bad friend or antisocial every time I wanted to bum around in my room alone. I love being around people -usually- but sometimes it was all too much to handle. <br /><br />
I used to think this was a problem with me, so I forced myself to sit outside, forced myself to hangout in the efforts of being "more social". This backfired. I was grumpy, short tempered, and though I was surrounded by people, I made zero efforts to connect and bond. I pulled a stone face, sat in the corner of the room, and labeled it "socializing". <br /><br />
It's <em>okay</em> to want to be alone. I draw energy from being by myself, and I've learnt that this is not a bad thing. Sometimes all you need is a quiet space, a locked door, and a lack of other people around you. Sometimes you can be grumpy, you can hate the world, and you can withdraw into yourself. This isn't an indication of being "antisocial". This doesn't mean that you don't want to hang out. In a high-stress environment like MIT, I've learnt that I needed to be alone for my own sanity. So I did. 
<br />
<br />
<strong>3. Why the fuck not?</strong><br /><br />
Growing up, I loved scheduling and lists. I was obsessed, like 5 different diaries and calendar print-outs obsessed. Everything was listed, everything was sticky noted, and everything I did was for a predetermined purpose. I had my life plan drawn out at 12, and was dead on track as I headed into college.
Then I did a complete switcheroo and everything went haywire. Gone were the plans of becoming a neurosurgeon, getting a phd, and becoming a professor. I declared Computer Science as my major, something I've never touched prior to MIT. I started dancing, started to dabble in design, and built apps and websites. What the fuck happened?<br />
There was a dark period first semester of sophomore year where I really doubted everything I was doing. I felt as if I had lost all sense of direction and purpose to where I was going--I had no plan. I felt as if I was slowly being suffocated by the uncertain and there was nothing I could do to stop it. What the fuck was I doing being a computer science major? I was 5 years behind everyone, in a field I had only become interested in months prior. What was I going to do when I graduate? Frontend design? Database stuff? Devops? What the fuck was the difference between Operations and Devops? Should I go to grad school -- can I even get into grad school? <br /><br />
I was pissed. I had a perfect plan. I should have stuck with it. <br /><br />
It took a breakdown and many long conversations to figure things out. It's still a work in progress, but I'm slowly moving away from "things I should do because X", to "things I want to do, because why the fuck not". While it's extremely scary, it's okay that I don't have a concrete goal of where I want to go a couple years down the road. What matters now is learning as much as I possibly can, and in the process, discovering what I really love to do. I took a bunch of classes I was extremely interested in second semester sophomore year-a 5 class course load of which 4 were project classes. Feedback was pessimistic: "Why are you taking 4 project classes? You're going to die." "You can't take 6.170 AND an open source class." Each time my response was the same: because I want to. <br />
Yes, you shouldn't overload yourself. Yes, you should be aware of your limits. But you shouldn't use that as an excuse to back down on things you really want to do, both academic and otherwise. I've learnt so much by deviating from plans, by doing things that I <em>wanted</em> to do. Sometimes it might not be the "smartest move", sometimes it might be completely unnecessary and useless. Sometimes it turned out to be a mistake. But often enough, it would turn out amazing and rewarding, all because I decided "why the fuck not".
