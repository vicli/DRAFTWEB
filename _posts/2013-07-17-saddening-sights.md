<u>MUNI bus #12. 7:30PM on Jul 17th, 2013 </u>

"Want to hear a story son? This was when I was back in jail." He takes a sip out of a can of soda.<br/>
"I've heard this one dad." The kid's probably 8, chubby, clutching a plastic bag. <br/>
"No no, I promise you haven't heard this one. Let me tell you, it's fucking funny." Another sip.<br/>
*sigh* "Okay, fine."<br/>

"What the fuck did you just say?"<br/>

"I said tell me the story." The kid shifts uncomfortably.<br/>
"No you didn't, don't give me that fucking attitude. You know what, let me tell you, I didn't like what you did back there. When someone offers me a beer, don't go 'he already has two in the bag'. Don't fucking do that, I swear, you fucking ruined it." He finishes whats left in the can and crushes it.<br/>
"But you already have two dad."<br/>
"That was fucking free beer, it was <strong>free</strong>. Do that again and I'll never bring you anywhere, you hear me?"<br/>
The kids remains silent.<br/>
"HEY, you hear me?"<br/>
"Yeah dad."<br/>
"Good. Now hand me another one."<br/>
The kid shifts seats. "No dad, you've already had one."<br/>
<br/>

I glance over, and recognize the can of Budlight. The plastic bag the kid's clutchin is black, and clinks lightly. <br/><br/>

"WHAT DID YOU FUCKING SAY?" He throws the crushed can on a seat. "What did you <em>FUCKING</em> say to your dad?"<br/><br/>

"I said you had one already. You told me you would have only one!" The kid raises his voice.<br/><br/>

"No, you don't get to tell me what to do. You're just a fucking kid, you don't know shit. Now hand me another one." He grabs at the plastic bag.<br/>

"NO YOU SAID THIS WAS FOR LATER." The kid hugs the bag, his voice trembling slightly. "YOU'VE ALREADY HAD ONE."<br/><br/>

I looked away, afraid of what would happen. <br/>

To my surprise, the dad starts laughing. "You piece of shit. Anyway, listen up. When we get there, you give one to Tony, one to ..uh.. Mike. Okay? One for Tony and one for --"<br/>
"I heard you the first time."<br/>
As the bus pulls to a stop, the dad reaches over and fist bumps the kid. <br/><br/>

"C'mon, this is our stop. Watch your step."<br/>
